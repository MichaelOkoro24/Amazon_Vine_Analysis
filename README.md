# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
For this analysis we helped Sellby perform an analysis of how their products compare to the reviews of similar products by their competitors.Using PySpark, Pandas, or SQL we will determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset

There is not a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program for U.S cameras. For the total reviews of the vine program was 607 and there was less than half of that for 5 star reviews at 42.3%.  Another analysis we could do is use more datasets that are different categories from the Amazon Review datasets.
